### The recipes you should have
* Zotero version 7.x (my example is 7.0.15)
* Awesome GPT plugin for zotero (if you don't have one, check "Awesome GPT installation" below)
* A Gemini API (if you don't have one, check "Getting Gemini API" below)
* A SiliconFlow API (if you don't have one, check "Getting SiliconFlow API" below)
If you have all above, you can jump to "Deploy" section!

### Awesome GPT installation
You can download it from the [Zotero Chinese forum](https://zotero-chinese.com/plugins/) or the [github release](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-gpt/releases).
