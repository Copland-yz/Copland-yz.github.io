Once you successfully deploy it, you can let AI summarize a paper for you with one click, or select a few papers in the same field and ask for a review, get a new idea based on their correlations, or ask if there is a knowledge gap in this field etc. Check it out!

### The recipes you should have
* Zotero version 7.x (my example is 7.0.15)
* Awesome GPT plugin for zotero (if you don't have one, check "Awesome GPT installation" below)
* A Gemini API (if you don't have one, check "Getting Gemini API" below)
* A SiliconFlow API (if you don't have one, check "Getting SiliconFlow API" below)

If you have all above, you can jump to "Deploy" section!

### Awesome GPT installation
You can download it from the [Zotero Chinese forum](https://zotero-chinese.com/plugins/) or the [github release](https://github.com/MuiseDestiny/zotero-gpt/releases).
In Tools->Plugins, click this little gear, you can choose to "Install Plugin From File". Choose the file (zotero-gpt.xpi) you just downloaded, and your installation is complete (hopefully)!
